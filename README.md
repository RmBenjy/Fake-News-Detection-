# Fake News Detection System
Misinformation has become a significant global issue, often causing confusion, panic, and even violence, especially when false narratives target sensitive topics like politics or religion. To address this, Iâ€™ve developed a machine learning project focused on fake news detection using Python. The goal of this project is to train a model that can accurately classify news headlines as either real or fake. The dataset used includes the news title, full content, and a label indicating the authenticity of the news. By analyzing the patterns and language commonly found in fake news, the model learns to distinguish between misleading and legitimate headlines, offering a reliable way to combat the spread of misinformation.
